    description: "The BMW i4 is the brand's first all-electric Gran Coupe, based on a modified version of the CLAR platform used for the 4 Series Gran Coupe. Unlike the bespoke platform of the earlier i3, the i4 represents BMW's new approach of offering electric variants within existing model lines. The exterior design closely resembles the conventional 4 Series Gran Coupe, with distinctive blue accents and aerodynamic enhancements identifying it as an electric model. The i4 is available in multiple variants, including the eDrive40 with a single rear motor producing 335 HP and the high-performance M50 with dual motors generating a combined 536 HP and all-wheel drive capability. The 83.9 kWh (net capacity) battery provides a range of up to 301 miles for the eDrive40 and 270 miles for the M50 (EPA ratings). Inside, the i4 features BMW's curved display combining a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 14.9-inch infotainment screen running BMW's iDrive 8 system. The vehicle supports DC fast charging at up to 200 kW, allowing a 10-80% charge in approximately 31 minutes. The i4 M50 is significant as the first all-electric BMW M-branded vehicle, delivering M3/M4-rivaling acceleration with 0-60 mph times of around 3.7 seconds. The i4 represents BMW's strategy to electrify its core lineup while maintaining brand-characteristic driving dynamics and premium features."
